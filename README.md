## üßë‚Äçüíª Team Roles

In this project, each team member plays a vital role to ensure the successful development of our Airbnb Clone. Below is a breakdown of the key roles and their responsibilities:

### 1. Backend Developer
- **Responsibilities**: Designs and implements the server-side logic of the application. Works with APIs, frameworks, and databases to ensure data is handled correctly and efficiently. Ensures RESTful routes and security practices are followed.

### 2. Database Administrator (DBA)
- **Responsibilities**: Manages the structure and organization of the database. Responsible for schema design, indexing, performance tuning, backups, and ensuring data integrity throughout the application lifecycle.

### 3. DevOps Engineer
- **Responsibilities**: Manages infrastructure, deployment, and CI/CD pipelines. Ensures the application is scalable, reliable, and efficiently deployed across environments using tools like Docker, GitHub Actions, and cloud services.

### 4. Project Manager
- **Responsibilities**: Oversees planning, coordination, and communication within the team. Tracks progress against project timelines and ensures deliverables are completed on time. Facilitates team meetings and resolves blockers.

### 5. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
- **Responsibilities**: Ensures the application meets quality standards. Writes and executes test cases, reports bugs, and works closely with developers to fix issues before deployment.

### 6. API Designer
- **Responsibilities**: Plans and structures the RESTful API endpoints. Defines how the frontend and backend systems communicate, including data formats, request/response structure, and error handling strategies.



## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

Below is the list of technologies used in this project and their purpose within the Airbnb Clone:

### 1. Django
- **Purpose**: A high-level Python web framework used to build robust and scalable RESTful APIs quickly and securely.

### 2. Django REST Framework (DRF)
- **Purpose**: An extension of Django that simplifies the process of building and managing REST APIs, including serialization and authentication.

### 3. PostgreSQL
- **Purpose**: A powerful, open-source relational database used to store structured data such as users, listings, bookings, and reviews.

### 4. Docker
- **Purpose**: A containerization tool that packages the application and its dependencies into isolated environments, making it easier to develop, deploy, and run consistently across machines.

### 5. GitHub Actions
- **Purpose**: Used to automate workflows like testing, linting, and deployment, ensuring continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).

### 6. GraphQL *(if applicable in your project)*
- **Purpose**: An API query language that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

### 7. Gunicorn
- **Purpose**: A Python WSGI HTTP server used to serve the Django application in production environments.

### 8. Nginx
- **Purpose**: A high-performance web server used as a reverse proxy to handle incoming HTTP requests and serve static files.

### 9. Swagger / Postman
- **Purpose**: Tools for documenting and testing APIs, allowing developers to understand and interact with endpoints more easily.
